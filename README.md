<h1 align="center">🤖 ChatBotAsService</h1>

A robust, scalable, and production-ready SaaS chatbot platform leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), AWS Bedrock, FAISS, and modern cloud infrastructure for intelligent, context-aware conversations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

ChatBotAsService is a multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) chatbot application designed to deliver intelligent, context-aware conversational experiences. By integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it combines advanced vector search capabilities with state-of-the-art generative AI. The platform is powered by AWS Bedrock for embeddings and response generation, FAISS for efficient semantic search, and a robust cloud-native infrastructure to ensure scalability, security, and performance.

This project is ideal for organizations seeking to deploy customizable chatbot solutions for customer support, knowledge management, or interactive user experiences.

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

The application is deployed across multiple cloud platforms to ensure scalability, reliability, and performance:

| Layer          | Platform            |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| Frontend       | AWS Amplify         |
| Backend        | AWS EC2             |
| Vector Data    | AWS S3              |
| Database       | Render (PostgreSQL) |
| CI/CD Pipeline | GitHub Actions      |

### Deployment Steps

**Frontend Deployment:**

* Push the `frontend/` directory to a GitHub repository.
* Connect the repository to AWS Amplify for automated builds and hosting.

**Backend Deployment:**

* Deploy the backend to an AWS EC2 instance using Docker or PM2.
* Configure environment variables in `config/`.

**Database Setup:**

* Provision a PostgreSQL instance on Render.
* Initialize the database schema using Sequelize migrations.

**Vector Storage:**

* Configure AWS S3 buckets for storing FAISS `.index` files.

**CI/CD:**

* Set up GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and deployment.

## 💬 Embedding and Search Workflow

The chatbot leverages a sophisticated pipeline for processing and responding to user queries:

1. **Content Ingestion 📄** Users upload documents or input data via the frontend.
2. **Embedding Generation 🧠** AWS Bedrock generates high-dimensional embeddings for the input data.
3. **Vector Indexing 🗂️** Embeddings are indexed using FAISS for efficient similarity search.
4. **Storage ☁** FAISS `.index` files are securely stored in AWS S3.
5. **Query Processing 🔎** User queries are matched against the FAISS index to retrieve relevant context.
6. **Response Generation 🤖** AWS Bedrock generates natural, context-aware responses using the retrieved data.
