  "RE SCOPE\n•REFERENCES \n\nABSTRACT\nNRolEHub is a digital event management suite for educational\ninstitutions, eliminating inefficiencies in manual processes. It automates\nkey tasks like registration, participant tracking, and certificate generation,\nensuring accuracy and efficiency. The platform features secure payment\nintegration, real-time reminders, and automated certificate issuance. Built\nfor scalability and robustness, NRolEHub optimizes event coordination\nand enhances the user experience thr",
